#### Bill Reyner Visits Hunter College

On Thursday, October 17, Bill Reyner presented in my open source development course. He helped me better understand how a cooperate uses open source software. He explained how they can benefit from open source software in a cooperate setting and what are the pros and cons of that. I understand that using open source software can have some challenges in such a setting. For example, the projects with the gnu liscene had to be ignored because they cannot be used in this setting due to the legal bindings. Some of the code had to be kept secret.

#### My First Attempt to Contribute

I was looking all over for a project to contribute to. I want to start out small and make a documentation fix. Finally, after looking around for hours, I found a project called codezilla which is an open source project that contains algorithms. I thought that this was a great idea for an open source project. I would love to contribute to it. I started looking through the sortig algorithms. There I found that QuickSort has a readme file that has some grammatical errors that need to be fixed.I decided to stop here and work on this. 

#### Summary of this Week

This week I was mostly looking for a project to contribute to. I also made some more contributions to OpenStreetMap. There are many things that I can add to my neighborhood. I was surprised to find many wrong information on OpenStreetMap.There is a lot that I can fix.
