## My Search For a Project 

After weeks of preparing to contribute to open source software, I am finally going to find the ideal project to contribute to.
Before doing that, I wanted to sum up what I am looking for in a project before even considering to contributing to it. 

* It must have a license. 

A project without a license tells me that it is not open source and therefore its something that I cannot contribute to. 

* The README file

I want to make sure to read the README file in order to determine what the project is about which will help me better understand how to use and work on it. 

* A contributing document 

The contributing document is espeically important because its a guide for people like me who are looking forward to contributing to the project and improving it. 

* A code of conduct document 

I find it important that this file is included in the project because it gives me a sense of how welcoming the project is to people who are looking to contribute. 

These are the documents that I want to read before accessing if I want to contribute to these projects or not. There are some projects that I have found while searching:

#### OpenGenus 

I remember thinking when reading the README file that this community seems to be very welcoming, positive, and encouraging but then I realized that it is probably not open source since there is no license file and in order to join, they have to add you as a member. So I rejected this project and moved on to another project that I can potientally contribute to and that looked more like an open source project.
