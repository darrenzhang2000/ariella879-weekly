####How I Edited My Classmate's Blogs

Today, I edited a classmate's blog. The process was fairly simple. First, I forked my her repository. Then, I cloned it manually in my terminal to my local machine. From there I was able to cd to the directory and go to her file. I opened her file and added the changes. I pushed the changes by using the command push -u origin. I suggested that she remove some extraneous words that were not needed in her document.

####How Is This Process Different From the Slides

This process was different from the slides because there it was stated that one has to ask the maintainers if an issue was to be fixed and this would result in less merge conflicts.

####Summary of The Week

This week we focused on learning Git. At first this process was very confusing for me but then I got the hang of it. I enjoyed learning the commands that we could do from our terminal. I was very grateful that our professor gave us a Git cheat sheet amoung other materials. I found this very helpful.
