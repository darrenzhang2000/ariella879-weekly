#### My Project Evaluation

The project evaluation that I did was difficult because at first, I found it hard to find all the information. 
Especially finding how many lines of code there were particularly difficult because there are a lot of repositories and a lot of code files scattered all over the repositories. Counting that was very tedious, time-consuming, and difficult. It was defintely the most difficult task.  Some other tasks were also difficult. It took me a while to find how many maintainers there are. But overall, the ask was not that difficult to do. It just took time to get used to the format of github. 
Thanks to the template, I was able to realize how welcoming and active the project that I was evaluating was. I learned that it was very welcoming and the pull requests were being accepted or rejected daily. Yes, I am interested in the particular project that I evaluated now. 

#### Summary

This week we got into groups and learned how to evaluate projects, then we had to go home and evaluate projects the same way as we did in class.
