##  Thoughts on "Makers and Takers" by Dries Buytaert

This week I read the article [Thoughts on "Makers and Takers"](https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source). Some things that are agree with are that problems can arise in the open source community such as the monetization of an open source project without any contributions being made to it. It bothers me that this is a possibility. I agree that technology companies should become open source. This reminds me of the visit of Karen Sandler where she descibred that her heart defibrillator is not open source and she decscibred the importance of that and how that can lead to bugs. It really opened my eyes to the importance of open source and my overall decision to agree with this article's point. I agree with the concept that takers hurt makers, and that takers don't contribute enough to open source project they tend to use for personal gain.
