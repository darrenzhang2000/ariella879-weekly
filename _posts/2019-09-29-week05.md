## Week 5

#### The article on finding a project to which you can contribute has a great amount of information and advice. It also has links to other webpages that help you in finding projects. Explore these links and comment on which might prove to be useful, and whether they have helped you to narrow down your search.

[This article](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to) contained a lot of useful information to help me get started and think about how I want to contribute to open-source projects. Fortunately, it also had other links that were also very helpful.
For example, it had a link to an article called [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com). This article explained how someone who was new to coding or who just was new to contributing to projects can find their role in the world of open-source software. I found it interesting how the article puts up Twitter posts of peoples' first time experiences contributing. I saw that most of them felt proud about it.
This article definitely proved to be useful because it provided even more links to help people who are new get started on their first contribution
I was very happy and excited to find out that there are actually some helpful resources to encourage and provide help to people like me. 

#### Make some comments about all of this git and GitHub stuff you learned about this week. Hard? Easy? Confusing? Useful?
